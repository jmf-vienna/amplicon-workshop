# Install R packages

Copy and paste this into your [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) console to install/update all required R packages:

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmf-vienna/amplicon-workshop/refs/heads/main/prepare/install.R")
```

The command can be run multiple times in case there were errors.

To verify all packages were successfully installed, run it one final time. The output should be something like this:

```
✔ All system requirements are already installed.
  
ℹ No downloads are needed
✔ 25 pkgs + 301 deps: kept 326 [4.2s]
```
